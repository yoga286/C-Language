We just showed you how to print text to the screen and in particular how to display multiple lines of text. In this activity, the goal is to print a list of skills you have already mastered to the screen.

The list of skills is the following:

I already know how to:
- Print text to the screen.
- Start a new line.
- Fix errors.
Be careful: as a C developer, you have to respect certain rules. You need to print exactly what you see in the above box!

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    printf("I already know how to:\n");
    printf("- Print text to the screen.\n");
    printf("- Start a new line.\n");
    printf("- Fix errors.\n");
    return 0;
}
